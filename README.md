# Survev Performance Index (SPI)

A paste-friendly **Streamlit app** to compute a single Survev skill rating from your mode stats (Solo/Duo/Squad).  
It combines **Kills/Game, Survival time, Average Damage, and Win%** with a **small-sample confidence weight** and gives you a **tier**.

## 🌟 Features
- Paste messy text from your Survev profile — the parser extracts just what we need.
- Manual overrides if parsing misses anything.
- Per-mode **SPI** + **Adjusted SPI** (confidence-weighted) + **Tier**.
- Games-weighted **Overall rating** across modes.
- Tunable confidence constant (in Settings).

## 🧮 Formula
Per mode:
- **Base (Consistency):** `Kills/Games × 100`
- **Survival (capped at 3:00):** `min(AvgSurvived, 180) / 180 × 50`
- **Damage:** `AvgDamage / 500 × 40`
- **Win Bonus:** `Win% × 2`

```
SPI = Base + Survival + Damage + WinBonus
```

**Confidence weight** to avoid 1–5-game spikes:
```
AdjSPI = 300 + (Games / (Games + 50)) × (SPI − 300)
```
**Overall rating** is the games-weighted average of per-mode AdjSPI.

**Tiers**
- Grandmaster: ≥ 750
- Master: 650–749
- Diamond: 550–649
- Platinum: 450–549
- Gold: 350–449
- Silver: 250–349
- Bronze: < 250
